# Neutrino and Antineutrino Oscillation Modelling with NOνA – Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used to compute, fit, and visualise data for different neutrino oscillation models as part of the SPA6776 Extended Independent Project.

## Notebooks Overview

- **`2x2 uncertainties.ipynb`**  
  Used in the *Methods* section. Computes the best-fit parameters and uncertainties for the two-flavour neutrino oscillation model.

- **`3x3 best params v3.ipynb`**  
  Estimates the best-fit parameters and uncertainties for the three-flavour model.

- **`3x3 literature params.ipynb`**  
  Plots the three-flavour model using parameters obtained from the literature.

- **`4x4 model.ipynb`**  
  Generates plots and results for the four-flavour model, as used in the corresponding results section.
